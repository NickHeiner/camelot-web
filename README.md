This project is my hobby space. I also take license to do wildly inappropriate things for a professional context, like pushing undeployable commits to `master` or not waiting for the CI tests to pass. #badass :smile:

## TODO
* Analytics
* Appropriate cursor for interactive board spaces
* Progressive Web App
