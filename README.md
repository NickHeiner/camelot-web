This project is my hobby space. I also take license to do wildly inappropriate things for a professional context, like pushing undeployable commits to `master` or not waiting for the CI tests to pass. #badass :smile:

## TODO
* Analytics
* Progressive Web App
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Animations
* Easier way to tell what the sequence of moves is
* Figure out how some files became 4-space indents and others became 2-space indents and fix it, lol.
